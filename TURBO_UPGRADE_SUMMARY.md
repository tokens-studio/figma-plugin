# Turborepo Upgrade Summary

## Upgrade Details
- **From:** Turbo v1.10.16
- **To:** Turbo v2.5.3
- **Date:** Latest upgrade completed successfully

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependency Update
- Updated `package.json` to specify `"turbo": "^2.5.3"` instead of `"latest"`
- Ran `yarn install` to update dependencies
- Verified version with `npx turbo --version`

### 2. Configuration Migration
- **Breaking Change:** Renamed `pipeline` to `tasks` in `turbo.json`
- This change is required for Turbo 2.x compatibility
- All existing task configurations remain the same

### 3. Updated turbo.json
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
    "globalDependencies": ["**/.env.*local"],
    "tasks": {
      "build": {
        "dependsOn": ["^build"],
        "outputs": [".next/**", "dist/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
      },
      "lint": {},
      "start": {
        "cache": false
      },
      "test": {},
      "test:watch": {}
    }
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Turbo version confirmed: 2.5.3
- ✅ Configuration validated with `npx turbo build --dry-run`
- ✅ All tasks properly recognized
- ✅ No errors in turbo.json parsing

## Alternative Upgrade Methods Attempted
1. **npx @turbo/codemod update** - Failed due to HTTP 504 timeout
2. **Manual dependency update** - ✅ Successful approach used

## Notes
- The upgrade included anonymous telemetry notice from Turborepo
- All existing task configurations remain functional
- The monorepo structure and package configurations are unchanged
- Future upgrades should use the `tasks` field instead of `pipeline`

## Next Steps
The upgrade is complete and ready for use. No further action required.
