# Task Directory

This directory contains task files that identify problematic areas and quick wins for the Tokens Studio Figma Plugin repository. Each `.md` file serves as a mini-PRD (Product Requirements Document) that can be picked up by another agent for implementation.

## Task File Format

Each task file follows this structure:
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Type**: Bug Fix, Performance, Code Quality, Documentation, etc.
- **Effort**: Small (< 1 day), Medium (1-3 days), Large (> 3 days)
