# Code Review Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive code review documentation for the Tokens Studio Figma Plugin, conducted October 2025.

## Documents

### 📊 [Executive Summary](./code-review-executive-summary.md)
High-level overview of findings, priorities, and next steps.

### ⚡ [Performance Analysis](./performance-analysis.md)
**CRITICAL for users with 4000+ variables and 10,000+ nodes**

Detailed analysis of performance bottlenecks including:
- O(n²) algorithms causing 15-30 second hangs
- Node traversal optimization opportunities
- Memory management issues
- React rendering performance

**Key Finding:** Current operations take 40-70 seconds for large datasets. Target: 5-10 seconds (85-90% improvement possible).

Security vulnerabilities and recommendations including:
- High-severity CVEs (2 found)
- Unsafe code patterns
- Input validation gaps
- Type safety issues

### 🏗️ [Architecture Improvements](./architecture-improvements.md)
Architectural recommendations for scalability:
- Data layer abstractions
- Event-driven architecture
- State management optimization
- Code organization

### 📝 [Code Quality Analysis](./code-quality-analysis.md)
Code quality metrics and improvement areas:
- Linting issues (50 warnings)
- TypeScript usage (152 'any' types)
- Technical debt (78 TODOs)
- Best practices

### 📦 [Dependency Updates](./dependency-updates.md)
Dependency management strategy:
- Security vulnerability updates
- Major version migrations
- Automated dependency management
- Bundle size optimization

### 🗺️ [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)
**ACTION PLAN** - Prioritized implementation guide with:
- Week-by-week breakdown
- Code examples for critical fixes
- Testing strategies
- Success metrics

## Priority Order

If you're new to these documents, read in this order:

1. **Start here:** [Executive Summary](./code-review-executive-summary.md)
2. **Most important:** [Performance Analysis](./performance-analysis.md) - Critical for large-scale users
3. **Security fixes:** [Security Issues](./security-issues.md) - Fix vulnerabilities ASAP
4. **Implementation:** [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md) - How to fix issues

Then review the other documents as needed.

## Quick Start for Fixes

### Immediate Action (Week 1)

```bash
# 1. Fix security vulnerabilities
cd packages/tokens-studio-for-figma
yarn upgrade @octokit/request@^8.4.1
yarn upgrade @changesets/cli@latest
yarn audit

# 2. Run tests
yarn test

# 3. Create branch for performance fixes
git checkout -b perf/critical-fixes
```

### Critical Performance Fix

The most critical fix is in `src/utils/validateGroupName.ts:59`. See [Performance Analysis](./performance-analysis.md#-critical-issue-1-on²-duplicate-detection) for full details.

## Metrics Summary

### Before Improvements

| Metric | Current | Impact |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Duplicate detection (4k tokens) | 15-30s | 🔴 BLOCKS UI |
| Node updates (10k nodes) | 8-15s | 🔴 BLOCKS UI |
| Security vulnerabilities | 2 high | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| 'any' types | 152 | 🟠 HIGH |
| Linter warnings | ~50 | 🟡 MEDIUM |

### After Improvements (Target)

| Metric | Target | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Duplicate detection | <0.1s | 99.7% faster |
| Node updates | 3-5s | 66-80% faster |
| Security vulnerabilities | 0 | 100% fixed |
| 'any' types | <50 | 67% reduction |
| Linter warnings | 0 | 100% fixed |

## For Enterprise Users

If you're managing design systems with:
- **4,000+ design tokens/variables**
- **Multiple token sets** (10-50 sets)
- **10,000+ nodes** on Figma pages

The [Performance Analysis](./performance-analysis.md) document is **critical reading**. It identifies specific bottlenecks that will impact your workflow and provides concrete solutions.

**Estimated impact of fixes:** Reduce typical operations from 40-70 seconds to 5-10 seconds.
