# Resolved Tokens Refactor Summary

## Overview
This refactor elevates the calculation of resolved tokens from individual components to a global level using the TokensContext. This eliminates duplicate calculations and ensures consistency across the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TokensContext (`/src/context/TokensContext.ts`)
- **Added TokensContextProvider component** that calculates resolved tokens once using:
  - `tokensSelector`
  - `usedTokenSetSelector` 
  - `activeTokenSetSelector`
- **Centralized resolved tokens calculation** using `defaultTokenResolver.setTokens(mergeTokenGroups(tokens, usedTokenSet, {}, activeTokenSet))`
- **Memoized the calculation** to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Provides resolved tokens** to all child components via context

### 2. Updated App Component (`/src/app/components/App.tsx`)
- **Wrapped the entire app** with `TokensContextProvider`
- **Positioned the provider** at the top level to ensure all components have access to resolved tokens
- **Maintained existing component structure** while adding the global context

### 3. Updated Tokens Component (`/src/app/components/Tokens.tsx`)
- **Removed local resolved tokens calculation** that was using `defaultTokenResolver.setTokens(mergeTokenGroups(tokens, usedTokenSet, {}, activeTokenSet))`
- **Removed TokensContext.Provider** wrapper since it's now handled globally
- **Updated to use context** via `React.useContext(TokensContext)`
- **Removed unnecessary imports** (`mergeTokenGroups`, `defaultTokenResolver`, `usedTokenSetSelector`)
- **Simplified component structure** by removing local context provider

### 4. Updated Inspector Component (`/src/app/components/Inspector.tsx`)
- **Removed local resolved tokens calculation** that was duplicating the same logic
- **Updated to use global context** via `React.useContext(TokensContext)`
- **Removed unnecessary imports** (`mergeTokenGroups`, `defaultTokenResolver`, `tokensSelector`, `usedTokenSetSelector`)
- **Simplified component logic** by removing local memoization

### 5. Updated InspectorTokenSingle Component (`/src/app/components/InspectorTokenSingle.tsx`)
- **Removed problematic line** that was trying to mutate `tokensContext.resolvedTokens = resolvedTokens`
- **Fixed dependency array** in useEffect to include `resolvedTokens`
- **Cleaned up component** to properly use the read-only context

### 6. Updated RemConfiguration Component (`/src/app/components/RemConfiguration.tsx`)
- **Removed local resolved tokens calculation** 
- **Updated to use global context** via `React.useContext(TokensContext)`
- **Removed unnecessary imports** (`mergeTokenGroups`, `defaultTokenResolver`, `tokensSelector`, `usedTokenSetSelector`, `activeTokenSetSelector`)
- **Simplified component logic** by removing local memoization

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Single calculation point**: Resolved tokens are calculated once at the app level instead of multiple times in different components
- **Memoization**: The calculation is properly memoized and only recalculates when dependencies change
- **Reduced redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate calculations in Tokens, Inspector, and RemConfiguration components

### Code Maintainability
- **Centralized logic**: All resolved tokens logic is in one place (TokensContext)
- **Consistent data**: All components use the same resolved tokens data
- **Simplified components**: Individual components no longer need to manage their own resolved tokens calculation
- **Better separation of concerns**: Components focus on their specific functionality rather than token resolution

### Data Consistency
- **Single source of truth**: All components get resolved tokens from the same source
- **Synchronized updates**: When tokens change, all components automatically get the updated resolved tokens
- **Eliminated race conditions**: No more potential inconsistencies between different components' resolved tokens

## Files Modified
1. `/src/context/TokensContext.ts` - Added provider component
2. `/src/app/components/App.tsx` - Added global provider wrapper
3. `/src/app/components/Tokens.tsx` - Removed local calculation, use context
4. `/src/app/components/Inspector.tsx` - Removed local calculation, use context  
5. `/src/app/components/InspectorTokenSingle.tsx` - Fixed context usage
6. `/src/app/components/RemConfiguration.tsx` - Removed local calculation, use context

## Implementation Notes
- The `TokensContextProvider` uses the same calculation logic that was previously used in individual components
- All components that previously calculated resolved tokens now use `React.useContext(TokensContext)`
- The context is read-only to prevent accidental mutations
- Dependencies for the memoization include `tokens`, `usedTokenSet`, and `activeTokenSet`

## Testing Recommendations
- Verify that all token-related functionality still works correctly
- Check that resolved tokens update properly when switching token sets or themes
- Ensure performance improvements are noticeable, especially when switching between tabs
- Test that broken token references are still properly detected and displayed
