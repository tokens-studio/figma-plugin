# Variable Preview Feature - Progress Tracking

## Current Status: Multi-Mode Fix Implemented ‚úÖ
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-19

## Feature Overview
Building a variable sync preview modal that allows users to preview all variable changes before applying them to Figma. Users can see which variables will be created, updated, or deleted and have granular control over what gets applied.

## Progress Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Basic variable sync preview modal implementation
- [x] Preview generation for variable creation, updates, and deletion
- [x] Category-level toggles for bulk operations
- [x] Individual item selection controls
- [x] Variable collection structure preservation
- [x] Font weight array handling and normalization
- [x] Variable value comparison logic improvements
- [x] Floating point precision fixes in comparisons
- [x] Variable reference resolution improvements
- [x] **Multi-Mode Support Fix** - Fixed preview logic to be collection-centric rather than theme-centric

### üöß Currently Working On
- [x] **Multi-Mode Support (STILL HAS ISSUES)**
  - ‚ùå Problem: Dark mode still not updated despite collection-centric fix
  - ‚ùå Problem: Exporting JUST Dark mode shows "No changes" when changes should exist
  - üîç **Investigation needed**: What comparison logic is used that causes false "no changes"?
  - üîç **Debug**: Add targeted logging to understand mode processing flow

### üîÑ Next Steps
- [ ] Test the multi-mode fix with actual Light/Dark theme setup
- [ ] Verify all modes receive proper value assignments  
- [ ] Test mode-specific token resolution
- [ ] Performance testing with large multi-mode collections

### üîß Recent Fix Applied
**Multi-Mode Collection Processing**: 
- Changed preview logic from processing themes individually to grouping by collection
- Now ensures every variable gets preview entries for ALL modes in its collection  
- Fixes the issue where only the first mode was updated and subsequent modes were ignored
- Uses collection-centric approach: collect all tokens per collection, then process each unique token path across all modes

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `src/plugin/previewVariableSync.ts` - Core preview generation logic with collection-centric processing
- `src/app/components/VariableSyncPreviewModal.tsx` - Variable sync preview modal UI
- `.changeset/famous-dragons-design.md` - Changeset for the multi-mode fix

### Issue Resolution Status: RESOLVED ‚úÖ
The multi-mode issue where "the second mode is never updated" has been fixed. The preview logic now correctly handles:
- Light/Dark mode collections
- Any multi-mode variable collection setup  
- Proper mode enumeration and value assignment
- Collection-centric rather than theme-centric processing

## Recent Commits
- famous-dragons-design: Fix multi-mode variable preview - ensure all modes in collection are processed correctly
- 858ab527: Consolidate debug logs to focus on Dark mode issues
- 77705307: Fix multi-mode variable collection handling and reference comparison
- 53529ca9: Fix variable reference resolution and floating point precision

## Summary
‚ùå **ISSUE PERSISTS**: The multi-mode collection fix didn't resolve the Dark mode problem. 

üîç **DEBUG LOGGING ADDED**: Enhanced console output now shows:
- Which themes are selected and processed
- Token generation statistics per theme  
- UPDATE/SKIP/CREATE decisions per theme
- Final summary breakdown by mode

**Ready for testing** - Use the enhanced logging to identify exactly why Dark mode shows "No changes" and whether it's being processed correctly.
