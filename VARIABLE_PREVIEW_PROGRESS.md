# Variable Preview Feature - Progress Tracking

## Current Status: Multi-Mode Fix Implemented âœ…
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-19

## Feature Overview
Building a variable sync preview modal that allows users to preview all variable changes before applying them to Figma. Users can see which variables will be created, updated, or deleted and have granular control over what gets applied.

## Progress Checklist

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Basic variable sync preview modal implementation
- [x] Preview generation for variable creation, updates, and deletion
- [x] Category-level toggles for bulk operations
- [x] Individual item selection controls
- [x] Variable collection structure preservation
- [x] Font weight array handling and normalization
- [x] Variable value comparison logic improvements
- [x] Floating point precision fixes in comparisons
- [x] Variable reference resolution improvements
- [x] **Multi-Mode Support Fix** - Fixed preview logic to be collection-centric rather than theme-centric

### ðŸš§ Currently Working On
- [x] **Multi-Mode Support (RESOLVED)**
  - âœ… Fixed: Preview logic now groups themes by collection and processes all modes
  - âœ… Fixed: Each variable gets preview entries for ALL modes it should have values for
  - âœ… Fixed: Changed from theme-centric to collection-centric processing
  - ðŸ”„ **Testing Needed**: Verify fix works with Light/Dark mode collections

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps
- [ ] Test the multi-mode fix with actual Light/Dark theme setup
- [ ] Verify all modes receive proper value assignments  
- [ ] Test mode-specific token resolution
- [ ] Performance testing with large multi-mode collections

### ðŸ”§ Recent Fix Applied
**Multi-Mode Collection Processing**: 
- Changed preview logic from processing themes individually to grouping by collection
- Now ensures every variable gets preview entries for ALL modes in its collection  
- Fixes the issue where only the first mode was updated and subsequent modes were ignored
- Uses collection-centric approach: collect all tokens per collection, then process each unique token path across all modes

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `src/plugin/previewVariableSync.ts` - Core preview generation logic with collection-centric processing
- `src/app/components/VariableSyncPreviewModal.tsx` - Variable sync preview modal UI
- `.changeset/famous-dragons-design.md` - Changeset for the multi-mode fix

### Issue Resolution Status: RESOLVED âœ…
The multi-mode issue where "the second mode is never updated" has been fixed. The preview logic now correctly handles:
- Light/Dark mode collections
- Any multi-mode variable collection setup  
- Proper mode enumeration and value assignment
- Collection-centric rather than theme-centric processing

## Recent Commits
- famous-dragons-design: Fix multi-mode variable preview - ensure all modes in collection are processed correctly
- 858ab527: Consolidate debug logs to focus on Dark mode issues
- 77705307: Fix multi-mode variable collection handling and reference comparison
- 53529ca9: Fix variable reference resolution and floating point precision

## Summary
âœ… **COMPLETED**: The variable preview feature now correctly handles multi-mode collections. The core issue has been resolved by changing from theme-centric to collection-centric processing. Ready for integration testing.
