Enhanced JSON editor syntax highlighting with improved Monaco Editor configuration. Added bracket pair colorization, semantic highlighting, better folding controls, and enhanced JSON language support. Implemented a custom inline JSON schema specifically designed for design tokens, providing better autocomplete, validation, and documentation for token types including color, typography, spacing, sizing, and all other supported token types in both standard and DTCG format.
