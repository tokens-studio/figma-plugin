**🎯 Auto-apply theme on component drop**

Introducing an exciting new feature that streamlines your design workflow! You can now automatically apply the current theme when inserting component instances into your Figma designs.

**What's new:**
No more manual token application after dropping components - they instantly inherit your theme styling
- ✨ **Smart theme application**: Automatically applies tokens from your active theme to newly inserted component instances
- ⚙️ **Configurable setting**: Toggle "Auto-apply theme on drop" in the plugin settings (bottom right) to enable/disable this behavior
