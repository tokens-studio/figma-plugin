"@tokens-studio/figma-plugin": patch

Expand undo functionality to cover more areas beyond individual token operations. Added undo support for token set operations (add/delete/rename/duplicate/reorder), token set state operations (toggle usage/active set), and bulk token operations (create/edit multiple tokens).
