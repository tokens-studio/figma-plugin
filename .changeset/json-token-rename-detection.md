"@tokens-studio/figma-plugin": patch
---

Add token rename detection in JSON editor with automatic remapping option. When users edit tokens in JSON view and rename tokens, the system now detects these changes and offers to remap references on the canvas automatically, similar to the existing UI-based token rename functionality.
