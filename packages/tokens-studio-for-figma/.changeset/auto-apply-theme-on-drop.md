Add auto-apply theme on drop setting

Added a new setting "Auto-apply theme on drop" in the Settings dropdown that automatically applies the current theme's tokens when component instances are inserted into your Figma document. When enabled, this feature eliminates the need to manually apply tokens after dropping components, streamlining your design workflow.
