# GitHub Sync Optimization

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of GitHub sync optimization for multi-file sync in the Tokens Studio Figma plugin. The optimization reduces unnecessary writes, improves sync times, and minimizes commit history bloat by only pushing JSON files that have actual changes.

## Problem Statement

Previously, when syncing to GitHub in multi-file sync mode, the plugin would push all JSON files regardless of whether they had changed or not. This resulted in:

- Unnecessary writes to the repository
- Longer sync times
- Bloated commit histories
- Increased risk of merge conflicts
- Difficulty in reviewing actual changes

## Solution

The optimization introduces a comparison mechanism that:

1. Reads existing token files from the remote GitHub repository
2. Compares each remote file with its corresponding local version
3. Only pushes JSON files that have actual changes
4. Skips commits entirely when no files have changed

## Implementation Details

### New Methods Added

#### `getRemoteFileContents(): Promise<Record<string, string>>`

**Purpose**: Fetches the current content of all JSON files from the remote GitHub repository.

**Implementation**:
- Uses GitHub API to get directory tree structure
- Fetches content for each JSON file using raw content API
- Returns a map of file paths to their string content
- Handles errors gracefully with warning logs

**Key Features**:
- Recursive directory traversal
- Proper path normalization
- Error handling for individual file failures
- Uses GitHub's raw content API for accurate string comparison

#### `filterChangedFiles(changeset, remoteContents): Record<string, string>`

**Purpose**: Compares local changeset with remote content and returns only files that have changed.

**Implementation**:
- Iterates through each file in the local changeset
- Compares local content with remote content
- Normalizes whitespace for accurate comparison
- Includes files that are new (don't exist remotely) or have changed content

**Comparison Logic**:
```typescript
if (!remoteContent || localContent.trim() !== remoteContent.trim()) {
  filteredChangeset[filePath] = localContent;
}
```

### Modified Methods

#### `writeChangeset(changeset, message, branch, shouldCreateBranch?): Promise<boolean>`

**Enhanced Behavior**:
- Only applies optimization in multi-file mode (not single-file mode)
- Fetches remote content before processing changeset
- Filters changeset to only include changed files
- Skips commit entirely if no files have changed
- Logs optimization results for debugging

**Optimization Flow**:
```typescript
if (this.flags.multiFileEnabled && !this.path.endsWith('.json')) {
  const remoteContents = await this.getRemoteFileContents();
  filteredChangeset = this.filterChangedFiles(changeset, remoteContents);

  if (Object.keys(filteredChangeset).length === 0) {
    console.log('No files have changed, skipping commit');
    return true;
  }

  console.log(`Optimized sync: pushing ${Object.keys(filteredChangeset).length} changed files out of ${Object.keys(changeset).length} total files`);
}
```

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced API Calls**: Only pushes files that have actually changed
- **Faster Sync Times**: Fewer files to process and upload
- **Network Efficiency**: Less data transferred over the network

### Repository Management
- **Cleaner Commit History**: No commits when nothing has changed
- **Meaningful Diffs**: Only actual changes appear in commit diffs
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Fewer unnecessary file modifications

### User Experience
- **Faster Feedback**: Quicker sync completion
- **Better Debugging**: Clear logging of what files are being synced
- **Transparent Operation**: Users can see optimization in action

## Backward Compatibility

The optimization is designed to be fully backward compatible:

- **Single-file mode**: No changes to existing behavior
- **Multi-file mode**: Enhanced with optimization, but fallback to original behavior on errors
- **Error Handling**: If optimization fails, falls back to pushing all files
- **API Compatibility**: No changes to public API surface

## Testing

### Unit Tests Added

1. **Skip Commit Test**: Verifies that commits are skipped when no files have changed
2. **Partial Update Test**: Ensures only changed files are pushed when some files differ
3. **Single-file Mode Test**: Confirms no optimization is applied in single-file mode

### Test Coverage
- Mock GitHub API responses for remote content
- Simulate various file change scenarios
- Verify correct API calls are made with filtered changesets

## Configuration

The optimization is automatically enabled for:
- Multi-file sync mode (`this.flags.multiFileEnabled = true`)
- Directory-based paths (not single `.json` files)

No additional configuration is required.

## Critical Bug Fix: File Deletion Logic

### The Problem
During initial implementation, a critical bug was discovered where files were being incorrectly marked for deletion when only adding/modifying content (like adding themes).

**Scenario**: User adds themes to `$themes.json`
- ✅ **Expected**: Only `$themes.json` should be updated
- ❌ **Bug**: All other files were marked for deletion

### Root Cause
The deletion logic was incorrectly checking against `filteredChangeset` (only changed files) instead of `changeset` (all files that should exist):

```typescript
// ❌ INCORRECT - causes unwanted deletions
const filesToDelete = jsonFiles.filter((jsonFile) =>
  !Object.keys(filteredChangeset).some((item) =>
    jsonFile.path && item === joinPath(this.path, jsonFile.path)
  )
);

// ✅ CORRECT - preserves existing files
const filesToDelete = jsonFiles.filter((jsonFile) =>
  !Object.keys(changeset).some((item) =>
    jsonFile.path && item === joinPath(this.path, jsonFile.path)
  )
);
```

### The Fix
**File deletion logic must use the original `changeset`**, not the optimized `filteredChangeset`. This ensures:

1. **Optimization works correctly**: Only changed files are pushed
2. **File operations preserved**: Existing files are not accidentally deleted
3. **Rename/delete operations work**: Actual file operations still function as expected

### Verification
After the fix, the logs should show:
```
🗑️ Files to delete (0): []  // When only modifying existing files
📤 Final GitHub API call:
  • Files to create/update: 1
  • Files to delete: 0
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

- **Network Failures**: Graceful fallback to original behavior
- **API Errors**: Warning logs with continued operation
- **Individual File Failures**: Skip problematic files, continue with others
- **Malformed Content**: Safe string comparison with trim normalization

## Enhanced Logging

The optimization provides comprehensive logging to help developers understand exactly what's happening during sync:

  • Files to delete: 1
  • Commit message: "Update token colors and add new color palette"
  • Branch: main
```

### Skip Scenarios
```
✅ No files have changed, skipping commit
```

### Error Handling
```
console.warn('Failed to fetch remote file contents:', error);
console.warn(`Failed to fetch content for ${filePath}:`, error);
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Caching**: Cache remote content to avoid repeated API calls
2. **Batch Operations**: Optimize API calls for large repositories
3. **Diff Algorithms**: More sophisticated change detection
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to disable optimization if needed
5. **Metrics**: Track optimization effectiveness and performance gains

## Technical Notes

### GitHub API Usage
- Uses `application/vnd.github.raw` accept header for raw file content
- Leverages existing tree traversal logic for consistency
- Maintains proper error handling patterns from existing codebase

### Memory Considerations
- Remote content is loaded into memory for comparison
- Content is released after comparison completes
- Suitable for typical token file sizes (usually < 1MB per file)

### Type Safety
- All new methods are fully typed with TypeScript
- Maintains existing type contracts
- Uses proper error handling with unknown types
