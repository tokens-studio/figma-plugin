# @tokens-studio/figma-plugin

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- f6398c7a: Fixed an issue introduced in 2.1.0 that sometimes caused the order of token sets to not be as expected, meaning sets that acted as overrides didn't correctly get calculated.
- fe94d6a3: Resolved an issue with Bitbucket sync where deleted sets were still being reflected in the tokens repository.
- bf8c185a: Fixed a bug where applying themes using "Prefix styles with active theme name" didn't correctly apply the right styles.
- cddfb5ba: Fixed an issue with "zombie variables". Basically, even though a Figma file shows 0 variables, Figma's plugin API will sometimes tell us there's variables existing - probably ones that existed in the past but should be deleted - Figma seems to report those as existing still. This led to issues around applying and referencing variables where we'd point to those zombies. We now correctly check if the variable's collection still exist, and only then use those as references.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0bc599e0: Changed logic around how we create styles or variables around Theming, as well as the logic around token sets and themes. 2.0 introduced some changes that made the whole process more strict. This change now changes things the other way around, we're less strict. Basically, if you export themes and you are exporting multiple themes at once, we now look at the overall configuration of token sets and pass these on as tokens to use for resolution. Meaning, you should not run into issues where you have broken references anymore just because a token set was disabled. If a set contains a token - even if the set is disabled - we will use it to resolve references.
- e1838a32: Fixes issue where styles are not applied in Figma, when user exports Token Sets as Styles

### Patch Changes

- 417df53c: Raise limit for tokens in Tokens Studio sync to 3000 tokens per set
- 087b4c1e: Fixed an issue around variable creation where if numerical weights were used we'd display an error that we're unable to apply the font. We now changed this to properly load all weights of the font family and then create styles correctly with variable references to the numerical weight variable
- 2c60963c: Changed logic when "Remove styles and variables without connection to a token" is enabled where we now look at all created tokens in this session and remove them, instead of looking at each theme individually
- a81b9a9f: Add missing padding to list of token sets in Export Token Sets Tab
- fd68d5a5: Prevents falsy errors from displaying when pushing to GitLab and ADO
- 087b4c1e: Fixes variable creation of color token was using a modifier and using a reference. We now correctly create a raw hex value as Figma doesn't have modifiers. Before we falsely used a reference without the modifier applied
- 8f97ea63: Optimized the speed of importing variables. Importing should now feel drastically faster

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 9f8c0360: Fixes an issue where applied styles are not displaying in Figma, when the themes have been exported as non-prefixed styles from the plugin.

  Fixes the issue where applied styles are not displaying in Figma, when the themes have been exported with both 'prefix styles with active theme name' and 'ignore first part of token name for styles' options have been checked

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 1784f101: Fixes issues when synchronizing data with GitLab, which prevented creating new branches on the fly and switching between single and multi-file setups.
- 2dc668cc: Fixes the issue where only active themes were being exported as styles, even when multiple themes were selected in the options modal.

  Fixes the problem where applied styles were not being displayed in figma when the core/global theme was being activated.

- 22018a93: Fix a visual bug in the Resolve Duplicate Tokens modal

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 27d40280: Fixed several issues related to Azure DevOps related to pushing and creating branches other than the default one as well as switching between single file and multi file.
- dcb41eb1: Fixed an issue with Bitbucket sync that caused sets that are in folders to not be pulled correctly
- 3405929e: Fixed an issue with UI appearing broken, related to the debug session recording feature

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9c409b487: We now support the W3C Design Tokens Community Group format! The plugin offers a way to convert your tokens to the new format for remote as well as locally stored tokens. We also auto-detect if you're using the new format in your token files, and will use that format.

### Patch Changes

- 7ff4131a9: You can now use `rem` units in letter spacing tokens
- 61673a6d1: Fixes an issue where duplicating a token to another set incorrectly displayed an error message about token names needing to be unique.
- 9ce1434a3: Opacity tokens are now being created properly in Figma and are being applied as variables when available

- 467569b42: Fixes an issue that caused going from URL storage to Local storage to be in read-only until plugin restart
- 890c5b204: Non-local variables: You can now create variables that reference variables from other files, as long as you're using Themes and your variables are attached to tokens.
- 171823b7b: Fixed an issue that caused updating tokens that contained a modified reference to update multiple modes at once, instead of just the affected one.
- cdb570853: Using Select all in Inspect view when you were using a filtered view is now correctly only removing tokens that were selected, instead of all.
- 325d7d2d9: Color styles now contain a color variable as a value if the value is a pure reference to another token and that token is attached to a variable via Themes
- ffe0d6cc5: Allow users to export variables based on selected sets and export options
- 7ff4131a9: You can now use negative % values in line height tokens
- 3728cc19c: Allow users to create variables from selected sets when not using themes
- 81d2306bd: Provide ability to users to add nested levels to a token
- 4989732a7: You can now choose if you want variables and styles applied when you're updating your layers. This allows you to effectively make use of the plugin's theme switching even though you've created variables.
- a2f4479bd: Feature: You can now resize the left sidebar
- 75260aead: Added support for variables in typography styles
- 230842255: Fixed an issue with the plugins error boundary, error messages should now show up in the UI again
- bdddf04df: Typography tokens such as line heights, font sizes, paragrap spacing, paragraph indent and letter spacing now take number and dimension tokens as suggested tokens
- 483c52622: When you apply a token to a layer, and that token isnt connected to a variable, we will now try to apply the token's reference as a variable. This enables you to apply component tokens and have their semantic variable applied as long as it's a pure reference and that component token has no variable connected.
- cb230b001: Selecting something when typing { will now no longer insert a space after
- 0cb557937: Fixed an issue where variable references weren't using references from the current theme but from another theme that was using the same token names. If you are creating multiple collections with the same token structure, it's recommended to create them one by one to avoid reference clashes. For the default scenario of where different theme groups don't share the same tokens (recommended), you can create all themes at once.
- e83024a34: Options (use rem, convert numbers to dimensions) are now disabled by default for the Import variables dialog
- a66f76153: When editing a border token and switching from reference to input mode we now populate the contents.

- cbfc5cd7: Added an 'id' field to internal token usage containing a unique id per token, which helps with trackined token updates and performance.

### Patch Changes

- cbfc5cd7: Changed default `Apply to` setting to `Selection`, this should not change any already stored `Apply to` setting

- cbfc5cd7: Improves performance of internal token resolution logic. This should especially be visible on token sets that have deep nesting of references.
- cbfc5cd7: Fixes a bug that caused nodes to not get updates when min/max width tokens were applied on instances, which caused any subsequent updates to this node to fail. We now ignore instances for min/max width tokens, as they are unsupported by Figma.
